      <p>Michael Cumings is a new Full Stack Web Developer (having completed the University of Minnesota
        Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp program) living in Fargo, ND with his two children.
      </p>
      <p>He is a dedicated researcher, has experience making corporate training materials, and has an
        academic background in Church History and Philosophy.  He has an interest in projects related
        to tabletop games as well as APIs for Google services, and lately ML Kit.
      </p>
      <p>He has experience coding HTML, CSS, JavaScript and associated frameworks (particularly React),
        and SQL and NoSQL databases. He is determined to continue exploring new technologies to better
        meet any professional challenge.
      </p>
      <p>Substantial projects include <b>What's In There?</b>, an app that reads barcode labels on containers
        to keep track of their contents using Google Photos; <b>Peek</b>, a rudimentary social network platform 
        linking photos with locations and times; and <b>Baseline</b>, a web application for 
        evaluating professional self-presentation. Beta versions of these will be posted in the Portfolio
        section as they become available.  For now, the Portfolio section shows some coding
        exercises I have completed.
      </p>
      <p>The Contact section provides email and Linkedin links.</p>
